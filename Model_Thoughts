    Extracting with hop_length=2048 and n_fft=8192 with params
    model = stupidSimpleRNNModelTimeDisLess(inputDimension=20, numPerRecurrentLayer=200, numRecurrentLayers=3,
                                            outputDimension=numSegmentTypes)
    Yielded accuracy in the mid-high 70's after 20 epochs
    Probably (actually almost certainly) overfitting, but at least it learned something!
